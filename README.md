# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator written in Go that generates passwords based on user inputs and using an AI language model.

## Installation

To use this script, you will need to have Go installed on your system. You can download and install Go from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/

You will also need to install the closestmatch and gpt-2 packages. You can do this by running the following commands:

go get github.com/schollz/closestmatch
go get github.com/schollz/gpt-2

## Usage

To use the password generator, simply run the generate.go script using the go run command:

### go run generate.go

The script will prompt you to enter your name, surname, year of birth, phone number, and any nicknames you may have. It will then generate 10,000 passwords using a combination of the user inputs and additional words generated by the GPT-2 language model.

The generated passwords will be saved to a file called passwords.txt in the same directory as the script.
